title: Instrumenting JVM Programs With Frida
---

[Frida][frida] is very commonly used to instrument Android applications written in Java
and compiled to Dalvik bytecode. It is a less well known fact that Frida
gained support for instrumenting Java programs running on the HotSpot JVM in a
[recent version][frida-hotspot] which should work on most JVM versions running
on Linux and macOS.

Attempting to instrument a program using the default JVM shipped with most
Linux distributions should result in the following error:

```
[Local::PID::8297]-> Java.available

This is because Frida requires the JVM contain symbols in order to locate
specific functions required for instrumentation. The default JVM shipped with
most Linux distributions have symbols stripped.

```
$ nm /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64/lib/server/libjvm.so
nm: /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64/lib/server/libjvm.so: no symbols
```

The easiest way to obtain a JVM with symbols is by downloading a pre-built
binary from the [AdoptOpenJDK][adoptopenjdk] project. By configuring the
target program to use a JVM with symbols, Frida can then be used for 
instrumentation.

```

```

The full power of Frida can then be leveraged for reverse engineering and
analysis of Java programs.
